    <p class="para">Bonbonlicious is so much more than just a bakery shop. Our desserts are made fresh and of quality ingredients! 
        At BonBonlicious our goal is to bake a cake that not only reminds you of home but also opens you to a new world. 
        And while that's no easy request, the handcrafted recipes of our founders, Ben and Yun, are more than up to the task. 
        Each recipe uses the finest ingredients: real eggs, butter and cream cheese to bring you BonBonlicious perfection. 
        Bonbonlicious’s has been established since 2016, located in a beautiful town of Fargo, ND. 
        While cakes are at the heart of our kitchens, we’re big fans of other sweet treats as well: 
        cookies, tart, brownies and macarons bring a little variety to the party.
